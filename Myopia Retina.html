	<h1>Spatial Transcriptomic Atlas of the Chick Retina Differing in Response to Myopia.</h1>
    
    <p>
          Myopia is a significant public health concern in China, where early risk warning plays a crucial role in its prevention and control. Studies have shown a close relationship between the age of onset of myopia and its severity: the younger the age at which myopia begins, the longer its progression, the faster its rate, and the higher the final degree of myopia in adulthood. Therefore, the key lies in early risk warning, precise and efficient screening, and timely and appropriate intervention. The retina, as the primary responder to myopia induction, plays an important role in the progression of myopia. Changes in retinal function during the early stages of myopia may differ from those at the onset, and the stress response to myopia induction may vary among different cell types and subtypes, as well as different structural regions of the retina.
          <p>
	  This study employs spatial transcriptomics and single-cell transcriptomics to compare changes across different cell types and subtypes from the early to the late stages of myopia. By analyzing the differences in gene expression and cell interactions between myopic and normal retinas at the cellular and spatial levels, we found that the retinal phototransduction pathway tends to be upregulated in the early stages of myopia but shows the opposite trend in the later stages. Moreover, photoreceptor cells and subtypes of cones that receive red light may be the most affected cell types during the progression of myopia. Comparing the effects of myopia on different retinal structural regions revealed that the central area of the retina might be the most affected region. These findings provide a theoretical basis for proposing new early intervention treatment strategies and contribute to the early prevention and precise treatment of myopia. Additionally, this study explores the spatial expression characteristics of human myopia-related pathogenic genes in the chicken retina, providing theoretical support for the use of chicken models in myopia treatment research.

    <h2>Changes in Retina Function in Pre-myopic and Myopia </h2>
	</p>
	In my data, it is observed that within the photoreceptor cells, the Visual Perception pathway and the Phototransduction pathway are upregulated in the pre-myopic stage, while they are downregulated in the myopic stage. This suggests a differential regulation of these pathways during the progression of myopia.

	By comparing with the control groupâ€™s receptor intensity, it was found that in the retinal bipolar cells, the ON pathway is upregulated in the pre-myopic stage and downregulated in the myopic stage. Conversely, the OFF pathway shows the opposite trend. My hypothesis is that the ON pathway inhibits the onset of myopia, while the OFF pathway promotes the development of myopia.

	Comparisons were made of the affected pathways within the phototransduction pathway across different regions, revealing that the central region of the retina is the area most impacted during the development of myopia.
