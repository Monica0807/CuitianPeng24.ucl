        <h1>Analyzing molecular changes in the retina of chick myopia model using spatial and single-cell transcriptomics.</h1>
        
        <p>
            Myopia is a significant public health concern in China, where early risk warning plays a crucial role in its prevention and control. Studies have shown a close relationship between the age of onset of myopia and its severity: the younger the age at which myopia begins, the longer its progression, the faster its rate, and the higher the final degree of myopia in adulthood. Therefore, the key lies in early risk warning, precise and efficient screening, and timely and appropriate intervention. The retina, as the primary responder to myopia induction, plays an important role in the progression of myopia. Changes in retinal function during the early stages of myopia may differ from those at the onset, and the stress response to myopia induction may vary among different cell types and subtypes, as well as different structural regions of the retina.

        <h2>Key Functional Pathways in Myopia</h2>
        <p>
            After identifying overlapping DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, performing functional enrichment analysis, and validation, I discovered pathways associated with the progression of myopia, which exhibit cell-specific expression.

        <h2>Changes in Retina Function in Peripheral Retina and Central Retina</h2>
        <p>
            Leveraging the advantages of spatial transcriptomics, I quantified the number of DEGs in the central and peripheral regions of the retina and analyzed the expression levels of key molecular pathways in different retinal regions. This revealed that the central retina has a significantly greater impact on myopia compared to the peripheral region.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            This study revealed critical pathways and cell-specific responses involved in myopia progression, highlighting the central retina's predominant role over the peripheral region. The spatial and single-cell transcriptomics approach provided unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms driving myopia, enabling identification of potential intervention targets. Key pathways, including the WNT pathway in MÃ¼ller glial cells and ON/OFF signaling in bipolar cells, were identified as critical modulators in the myopia process, suggesting their relevance in early risk screening and targeted treatments. Furthermore, the validation of the chick model with human myopia-related genes underscores its applicability in translational research, paving the way for precision therapy development.
