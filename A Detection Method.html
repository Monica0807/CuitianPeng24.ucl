	<h1>Establishment of RPA-LFD visual detection method for animal influenza A virus</h1>
    
    <p>
		The study aimed to establish a recombinant polymerase amplification-lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) detection method for animal influenza A virus (IAV). The method utilized primers and probes designed based on the conserved sequence of the matrix protein (M) gene of IAV. The researchers optimized the reaction conditions, specificity, and sensitivity of the RPA-LFD method. The experimental results demonstrated that the RPA-LFD method specifically detected animal IAV without cross-reactivity with other viruses such as Newcastle disease virus, duck Tembusu virus, duck hepatitis virus, and gosling plague virus. This indicates a high level of specificity for the detection method. The method also showed a short reaction time and high sensitivity, as it was able to detect a plasmid standard with a minimum concentration of 10 copies/μL within 20 minutes at 35℃.To validate the method, 50 samples of duck pharyngeal swabs collected from a live poultry market were tested. The RPA-LFD method correctly identified 3 positive samples and the remaining samples as negative, which was consistent with the results obtained from PCR and virus isolation methods. This indicates the high accuracy of the established method. In conclusion, this study successfully established a visual RPA-LFD detection method for animal IAV. The method does not require any specialized instruments or equipment, making it easy to operate and rapid in detection. It has the potential to be used for rapid clinical detection and epidemiological research in basic laboratories. 	</p>
