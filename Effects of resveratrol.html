	<h1>Effects of resveratrol on antioxidant capacity and apoptosis of duck liver under acute heat stress conditions</h1>
    
    <p>
		Resveratrol (<b>RES</b>) is a non-flavonoid polyphenolic compound, which is a toxin produced by plants in response to pathogenic attacks and environmental stress. Studies have found that resveratrol, as a natural polyphenolic plant extract, has various functions such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-cancer, neuroprotective, cardiovascular protection, liver protection, anti-shock, and immune regulation, which has attracted wide attention. In the trend of reducing and replacing antibiotics, resveratrol has good prospects as a feed additive.
This study aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on the antioxidant capacity of Shanma ducks under acute heat stress. The study also aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol supplementation on the SIRT1 signaling pathway and antioxidant enzyme system in the liver.
	</p>

        <h2> Methods </h2>
	<p> 
		A total of 120 healthy female Shanma ducks with similar weights at 60 days old were randomly divided into two groups, with 60 ducks in each group. The control (C) group was fed a basic diet, while the resveratrol (RES) group was fed a basic diet supplemented with 400 mg·kg-1 of resveratrol. Both groups were kept at a temperature of (24±2) ℃. After 15 days, there was no significant difference in the weight of the ducks between the two groups. Subsequently, the ducks in each group were randomly divided into three subgroups, with 20 ducks in each subgroup. These subgroups were then placed in an artificial climate room at 39 ℃ for 0, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. After the heat stress treatment, serum samples and liver tissues were collected from the ducks. The mRNA and protein levels, as well as the apoptosis number of the SIRT1 signaling pathway and apoptosis-related genes, were detected using qRT-PCR, Western blot, and TUNEL techniques. The oxidation index in the serum and liver was measured using biochemical methods.	</p>
	
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p>
		In conclusion, the addition of 400 mg·kg-1 of resveratrol to the diet can activate the SIRT1 signaling pathway in the liver of ducks, reduce the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, and increase the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Resveratrol can improve the antioxidant capacity and anti-apoptosis ability of the duck liver, as well as mitigate oxidative damage caused by acute heat stress.
